Fantasy platform for elections

This app will work as follows:

User registration: Users would need to create an account to use the platform. They would provide their personal details, including their name, email address, and password.

Politician selection: Users would be able to select their team of politicians from a database of profiles. The profiles would include information about the politicians' policies, voting records, and other relevant information. Users would be able to filter and sort the profiles based on different criteria, such as party affiliation or issue area.

Budget allocation: Users would have a budget to allocate to their team of politicians. Each politician would have a different cost, depending on their profile and popularity. Users would need to balance their budget to create the best possible team of politicians.

Performance tracking: The platform would track the performance of each politician based on their voting records, speeches, and other relevant data. Users would be able to see how their team of politicians is performing in real-time.

Competitions and rankings: The platform would host competitions and rankings based on the performance of users' teams. Users would be able to compete with other users to see who has the best team of politicians.

News and updates: The platform would provide users with news and updates on the politicians they have selected, as well as the political process more broadly. Users would be able to stay informed about the latest developments in politics and how they might impact their team.

Overall, an app that is a fantasy platform where you can create a team of politicians could be an engaging and educational way to learn about politics and the political process. It could provide a fun and interactive way to stay informed about politics and encourage participation in the democratic process.
